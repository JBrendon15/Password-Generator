## Description

For this project we had to create a function that would generate a password based on the criteria that the user inputs. The inputs include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, numbers, and the length of the password. We used if statements to provide validations so that the the user inputs the correct character type for the password length. We also used if statements to validate that the user selected at least one type of character to be included in the password. Creating this project helped me understand that it is important to have validations so that the inputs provided by the user can ensure that the application is working as intended.
